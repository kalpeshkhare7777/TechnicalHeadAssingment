You need to create a Flutter project named "Sports App" and
develop 2-3 landing pages, including a profile page, home page, contact
us page, and sports page.
Logo : Logo.png
Mandatory Things:
1. Build an APK file for download on Android mobile devices. The
downloaded app should be named "Sports App" and use the provided
logo.
2. Upon opening the app, there should be a sliding window containing an
introduction to the app followed by a simple login view. Authentication is
not required; instead, create a simple button for guest login to access
the app.
3. Ideate and create a home page.
Other Things you can do:
1. Build some more pages
2. Use Rapid API to fetch apis in app - Rapid Api

Problem 2:
Investigate the steps required to publish an application on both the
Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, as well as the iOS build process.
Additionally, explore methods for integrating a feature into a Flutter
application that allows users to share posts to their Instagram Stories with
customization options.
For example, like in the Spotify app. We want to
share similar event posters.


Problem 3 Backend Task:
Research about aws s3 bucket and how will you use s3 bucket for
storing images and any files in node js

Submission Guidelines:
Submit one DOC file which includes the GitHub repository link for
problem 1. (In the repository, include all files of the Flutter project, and also
include the APK file.) In the same DOC file, include the answers for problem 2
and problem 3, along with the resources that you used.
